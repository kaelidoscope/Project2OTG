## 11056 Project 2 Outside The Grid


## Reflections

### Initial Concerns
<p>Beginning this project, I already had some experience with *Node.js*, *Node Package manager* and using *terminal*. So I didn't run into too much trouble installing Eleventy. I still felt a tad rusty in regards to CSS layout and some styling elements. Most notably resizing and positioning of images inside <code>div</code> containers.
<br>
I  also wanted to avoid as much <code>javascript</code> as possible, and really tried to keep my webpage simple.</p>

### The Good

<p> I wanted to try my hand at giving my online portfolio a redesign, as it needed a bit of love and still had some placeholder text in parts. I used **photopea** to create a logo design I was happy with, and tried my hand at a bit of **Sketchbook** to create a fractal effect. I also used photopea to invert the colours as I felt that fit more with the aesthetic I was aiming for.
<br>

I used my logo image to create a *favicon* and used a site called Favicon Generator to create the files as well as provide <code>head</code> with link tags for my HTML file. That took a bit of time to get working, and ended up needing adjustment of the file path directories, an utterly unneccessary headache and waste of a day.
<br>

I also found some of the eleventy tutorials rather complex and had a few days of just trying to get my head around extrapolating the information in relation to my project. I attempt to link <code>a</code> tags in my <code>header</code> to various sections of my webpage, but could only get the <code>footer</code> one working as I was able to assign an <code>id</code> tag in the html document. From this, I was also able to link my LinkedIn page, which was a small win for me.
<br>
 It literally wasn't until just now, as I'm typing up this using various markdown cheatsheets I've found exactly what I was trying to achieve by anchoring text in <code>.md</code> files.
<br>

I felt like I had a much smoother grasp of some of the flexbox layout concepts, and was kinda impressed with my <code>hover</code> styling in css. Honestly, my biggest hurdle was with inseting images into the <code>index.md</code> file.</p>
 

 
 ### The Bad
 
<p> I ran into quite a few problems along the way:

 - My header and footer had some issues with overlapping. That was rectified by removing <code>position: absolute;</code> from elements.
 - Struggled with some of the images resizing when using the <code>inherit;</code> value.
 - Planned for a responsive navbar but ran out of time.
 - Let's not talk about images in markdown files. The amount of sites I browsed...</p>


### Final Thoughts

<p>To summarise, I am happy with what I have produced. I believe there is plenty of room for growth and improvements as I progress through my degree, and the flexible nature of using **Eleventy** for this project allows for that level of adaptability. I've surprised myself more than I anticipated, especially in terms of CSS design.</p>
